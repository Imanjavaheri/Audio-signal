This project investigates direction-of-arrival (DoA) estimation of multiple sources 
using a linear microphone array. Two classical beamforming methods were 
implemented and compared: Delay-and-Sum (DAS) and MUSIC (Multiple Signal 
Classification). The objective was to analyze their performance in resolving closely 
spaced sources and the impact of microphone spacing on resolution and accuracy.
